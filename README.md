# expenseApp
This app is used to maintain the everyday expenses.

In this app, I made for those who has difficulty to manage the daily expenses. So this app is very useful to store small expenses such as in-coming and out-going. The user can easily view the expenses in the form of tubular interface and graphical interface using charts. I also managed the user profile with the login details.
